    <h2>Our Roman Adventure: Pasta, Pasta, Pasta!</h2>
    <p>Hi there! It's your favorite pasta enthusiasts, Aidan and Claire! We recently took a trip to Rome, and needless to say, it was a pasta-filled adventure. We ate so much pasta that we're pretty sure we started speaking Italian by the end of the trip. </p>
    <p>But let's be real, who can blame us? When in Rome, you gotta do as the Romans do, and that means indulging in all the delicious pasta dishes this city has to offer.</p>
    <p>One of our favorite spots was Castellos, where we had the most amazing  we've ever tasted. We even took a picture to commemorate the moment:</p>
	  <p> This tutorial is built for my girlfriend Claire, to teach her how to make pasta and get her making food just like the pros<P>

  <h2>Tips for Making Pasta from Scratch</h2>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Use the right flour:</strong> The best flour for making pasta is “00” flour, which is finely ground and has a high protein content. If you can’t find this type of flour, you can also use all-purpose flour.</li>
        <li><strong>Measure accurately:</strong> To ensure the perfect consistency of your pasta dough, it’s important to measure your ingredients accurately. Use a kitchen scale if possible.</li>
        <li><strong>Add eggs at room temperature:</strong> Using eggs that are at room temperature will help them combine better with the flour and will make it easier to create a smooth and elastic dough.</li>
        <li><strong>Knead the dough well:</strong> Kneading the dough is important to activate the gluten in the flour and to create a smooth, elastic dough. Be sure to knead the dough for at least 10-15 minutes, until it’s smooth and pliable.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6">
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Rest the dough:</strong> After kneading the dough, let it rest for at least 30 minutes before rolling it out. This will allow the gluten to relax and make the dough easier to work with.</li>
        <li><strong>Roll the dough thinly:</strong> For the best pasta texture, roll the dough out as thinly as possible. You can use a pasta machine or a rolling pin to achieve this.</li>
        <li><strong>Cut the pasta into the desired shape:</strong> Once the pasta is rolled out, cut it into the desired shape using a pasta cutter or a knife. You can make spaghetti, fettuccine, lasagna sheets, or any other shape you like.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the pasta in boiling salted water:</strong> To cook the pasta, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and add the pasta. Cook the pasta until it’s al dente, or firm to the bite, which usually takes 2-3 minutes for fresh pasta.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve immediately:</strong> Once the pasta is cooked, drain it and toss it with your desired sauce. Homemade pasta is best served immediately, while it’s still warm and fresh.</li>
      </ul>
